# NASAWallpaper

<p>This is a script that sets the desktop wallpaper of your mac to the nasa image of the day. 
It uses NASA RSS feed to get the images. 
You will have to change the permissions for delete_old.sh and download_file.sh to make them executable.
</p>
<p> This will work with a secondary screen as well(in fact was designed with a second screen in mind) </p>
